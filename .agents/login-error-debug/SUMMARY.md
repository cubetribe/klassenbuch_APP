# LOGIN ERROR DEBUG - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Problem
User `office@cubetribe.de` successfully logs in but immediately sees:
- Red "Offline" status indicator
- Error toast: "Failed to load events"
- Console error: `APIError: Request failed`

## Root Cause
**File**: `/app/api/events/route.ts` (line 60)
**Issue**: When user has no courses, the code tries to query with `{ in: [] }` which Prisma rejects, causing a 500 error.

```typescript
// BEFORE (BUGGY)
where.courseId = { in: courses.map(c => c.id) }; // Crashes if courses is empty []
```

## Solution Implemented
Added early return when user has no courses:

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
if (courses.length === 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    events: [],
    totalCount: 0,
    limit: filters.limit,
    offset: filters.offset,
    hasMore: false,
  });
}

where.courseId = { in: courses.map(c => c.id) };
```

## Testing Required
1. **New user login** - User with no courses should see empty dashboard (no errors)
2. **Existing user login** - User with courses should see events normally
3. **User deletes all courses** - Should handle gracefully

## Files Modified
- `/app/api/events/route.ts` - Added empty courses array handling (lines 60-69)

## Additional Issues Found
1. **Data Integrity**: User sees "1 Active Course" but API finds 0 courses
   - Likely cause: Course `teacherId` doesn't match `session.user.id`
   - Needs database investigation

2. **Misleading "Offline" Status**: App shows "Offline" when API fails (not network issue)
   - Should be fixed in frontend

3. **Hidden Error Messages**: Production returns generic "Internal server error"
   - Consider better error logging/monitoring

## Deployment Status
✅ Fix applied to codebase
⏳ Awaiting deployment to Vercel
⏳ Awaiting user verification

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Blocks all new user onboarding

## Risk
**LOW** - Simple null check, minimal code change
