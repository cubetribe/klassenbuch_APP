# AWS KIRO and Next.js Development Guide

## AWS KIRO is real and revolutionary

AWS KIRO is a legitimate AWS product - an AI-powered IDE launched in public preview in July 2025, built on Code OSS and powered by Claude Sonnet models. It represents a paradigm shift in development with its "agentic AI" approach and spec-driven development methodology, where developers write specifications that AI agents transform into comprehensive implementation. Unlike traditional coding assistants that offer line-by-line suggestions, KIRO maintains project-wide context and can autonomously perform multi-step tasks across files.

The IDE differentiates itself through its Hooks system for background automation, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extensibility, and comprehensive project understanding. During the preview period, KIRO is free with paid tiers planned at $19-39/month. Amazon Q Developer (which absorbed CodeWhisperer) remains AWS's primary coding assistant at $19/month for the Pro tier, offering real-time code suggestions, security scanning, and AWS service expertise. Both tools provide strong JavaScript/TypeScript support with specialized React development features.

## Best practices for Next.js 14+ initialization with AWS tools

Setting up a Next.js 14+ project with AWS coding assistants requires careful configuration of both the development environment and AWS services integration. Start by creating your project with TypeScript and the App Router enabled: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --app --turbopack`. Install the Amazon Q extension in VS Code and authenticate using either Builder ID (free) or IAM Identity Center (enterprise).

**Essential AWS SDK v3 Configuration:**
```typescript
// lib/aws-config.ts
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';

const awsConfig = {
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1',
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID!,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!,
  },
};

export const s3Client = new S3Client(awsConfig);
export const dynamoClient = new DynamoDBClient(awsConfig);
```

**Project Structure Best Practice:**
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── auth/[...nextauth]/
│   │   └── aws/
│   ├── (auth)/
│   └── dashboard/
├── lib/
│   ├── aws/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── utils/
└── types/
```

Configure your `next.config.js` for AWS deployment with standalone output mode and proper environment variable handling. Use Server Components for AWS SDK operations to keep credentials secure, and Client Components only for interactivity. Implement proper authentication using NextAuth.js with AWS Cognito for enterprise-grade security.

## Critical mistakes to avoid with AWS AI coding tools

The most dangerous mistake is deploying AI-generated code without thorough review. Studies show 30-50% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities. A July 2025 incident with Amazon Q demonstrated how malicious prompts could inject destructive commands, emphasizing the need for rigorous code review pipelines. Always use automated security scanning tools like Amazon CodeGuru Security alongside manual reviews.

**Over-reliance on generated code** leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities, missing error handling, and inefficient database queries. AI assistants often generate N+1 query problems and fail to implement proper parameterized queries. Performance issues arise from inefficient AWS service configurations, with common mistakes including wrong service tier selection, unnecessary API calls, and improper connection pooling in serverless environments.

**Security vulnerabilities** frequently appear in authentication flows, CORS configurations, and input validation. AI-generated code often uses `any` types in TypeScript, defeating type safety, and may expose sensitive credentials in client-side code. Database connection leaks and missing rate limiting are common backend setup mistakes that can lead to service outages and security breaches.

## Vercel deployment with PostgreSQL considerations

Deploying Next.js on Vercel with PostgreSQL requires careful attention to serverless architecture constraints. The critical consideration is **connection pooling** - serverless functions can quickly exhaust database connections. Always configure connection pools with `max: 1` per serverless instance and use connection pooling services like PgBouncer or Neon's built-in pooling.

**Database Provider Selection:**
- **Neon**: Best for feature branch workflows with instant database branching, scale-to-zero pricing
- **Supabase**: Ideal when you need authentication and realtime features built-in
- **Vercel Postgres**: Simplest integration but more expensive than direct Neon usage
- **AWS RDS**: Enterprise-grade but requires complex VPC configuration

**Environment Configuration:**
```javascript
// Connection pooling for serverless
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 1, // Critical for serverless
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```

Use Prisma or Drizzle ORM for database migrations with automated deployment pipelines. Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for database-driven content to reduce query load. Consider using Vercel Edge Config or Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

## Next.js App Router integration patterns

The App Router fundamentally changes how you structure Next.js applications with AWS services. **Server Components** should handle all AWS SDK operations, keeping credentials secure server-side, while **Client Components** manage interactivity and browser APIs. This separation is crucial for security and performance.

**Real-time Features on Vercel:**
Since Vercel doesn't support persistent WebSocket connections, use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates or integrate third-party services like Pusher or AWS API Gateway WebSockets. For simpler real-time needs, implement polling with SWR or React Query's automatic refetching.

**API Route Patterns:**
```typescript
// app/api/users/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const validated = userSchema.parse(body);
  // AWS SDK operations here
  return NextResponse.json(result);
}
```

Implement middleware for authentication, use Zod for request validation, and leverage Partial Pre-rendering (PPR) in Next.js 14+ for optimal performance. Dynamic imports and code splitting are essential for managing bundle size with AWS SDK dependencies.

## Security best practices for educational software

Educational software requires strict compliance with FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR regulations. **Never include actual student data in AI prompts** - always use anonymized placeholders. Implement comprehensive audit logging for all data access, with detailed tracking of who accessed what student information and when.

**Multi-tenancy Architecture:**
Educational platforms require careful tenant isolation. Use row-level security with tenant IDs, implement role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions for administrators, teachers, students, and parents. Each role should have precisely defined data access boundaries.

**Data Protection Requirements:**
- Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention policies (typically 3-7 years for educational records)
- Obtain verifiable parental consent for users under 13 (COPPA)
- Provide data subject rights for GDPR compliance
- Use content moderation for user-generated content

Configure AWS Cognito with proper multi-factor authentication, implement rate limiting based on user roles, and establish incident response procedures for potential data breaches. Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential for maintaining compliance.

## Local testing and production deployment workflow

Establish a robust development workflow using Docker for local PostgreSQL, Vercel CLI for environment synchronization, and comprehensive testing strategies. Use `vercel env pull` to maintain consistent environment variables across development and production.

**Local Development Setup:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp_dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

**CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:**
Deploy automated pipelines that run tests against a PostgreSQL service, execute database migrations, and deploy to Vercel. Implement preview deployments with database branching using Neon for isolated testing environments per pull request.

**Deployment Workflow:**
1. Run tests with database fixtures
2. Build and validate TypeScript
3. Deploy to Vercel preview (PR) or production (main branch)
4. Run database migrations post-deployment
5. Invalidate CDN caches if needed
6. Monitor application metrics and errors

Implement rollback strategies using Vercel's instant rollback feature, but note that database rollbacks require careful planning with reversible migrations. Use blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates and maintain automated backups before any schema changes.
